CW2 WPD2 submission ReadMe File

-In order to run the program enter "node index", if you have it installed and wish to use nodemon "nodemon index" also works
- to ensure node is installed running npm -v will display a version number if it is.

-there is a sample user created with the username "WPD2Example" and the password "wasspord" (it is not hard coded but bypasses the bug mentioned in my report, if you would 
like to see the bug registering a new user and attempting login will trigger it)

-For the majority of the code that was not directly discussed in the labs I referenced "https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb" and "https://dbdb.io/db/nedb" regularly,
especially when figuring out how to edit entries to the database.
